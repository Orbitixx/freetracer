# 👋 Orbitixx

We build privacy-first software that earns its place on your machine. Orbitixx products ship as self-contained binaries you can inspect, install, and trust—no background analytics, no perpetual subscriptions, no surprise network calls.

## What Drives Us
- **Privacy over profit:** We refuse telemetry, trackers, and data resale. If we do not need your information, we do not ask for it.
- **Offline-first experiences:** Products work the moment they land on your disk. Network access is optional and explicit.
- **Integrity in craft:** Clear communication, auditable code, and transparent security practices come standard.
- **Products, not bills:** You pay for value delivered—not for the privilege of keeping software running. Ownable tools beat recurring invoices.

## Built the Orbitixx Way
- **Freetracer** — a native, zero-tracking image flasher for macOS, designed to keep sensitive workflows entirely local.
- Minimal dependencies, fast startup, and scoped permissions are the baseline for every project we release.
- Every helper, service, and UI flow is documented so you can see exactly what happens under the hood.

## Our Privacy & Security Promise
- No analytics SDKs, no A/B testing, no silent pings—ever.
- Permissions stay scoped to the action you initiated; ambiguous requests fail closed.
- Optional update checks call a single transparent endpoint and are easy to disable.
- Security disclosures go directly to `product-security@orbitixx.com`, where we respond quickly and coordinate fixes before public release.

## Build With Us
- Review our contribution guidelines in `CONTRIBUTING.md` to see how we collaborate.
- Explore `docs/security-and-privacy.md` for the guardrails that shape every feature.
- Share feedback, ideas, and bug reports—thoughtful issues and discussions keep the ecosystem healthy.

Orbitixx exists to bring back trustworthy tools you can rely on for years. Thanks for building a more private, durable software world with us.
